This file is for hackerearth's machine learning challenge, where we were supposed to predict a rating for drugs for STD's based on some user ratings, drug data such as use cases, duration of dosage, customer reviews etc.
In this competition, I only used the feature columns other than user reviews (Sentiment analysis) and using Catboost model, I achievd a score of 92.7 (Rank 42 on leaderboard).
